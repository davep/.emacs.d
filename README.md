# .emacs.d

My personal Emacs config.

It makes heavy use
of [`use-package`](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), downloading
required packages from [elpa](https://elpa.gnu.org/)
and [melpa](https://melpa.org/). Even my own personal packages (which make
no sense being contributed to public package archives) live
in [a personal package archive](http://blog.davep.org/delpa/).

The current look of my
config
[started life in early 2016 when I killed off my original `~/.emacs` and started using what I think is a cleaner approach via `~/.emacs.d`](http://blog.davep.org/2016/05/26/starting_fresh_with_gnu_emacs.html).
About a year later I made a few more significant changes
to
[make things work even better](http://blog.davep.org/2017/04/01/another_revamp_of_my_emacs_config.html),
with
[another big revamp to switch from using `customize` happening about 3 months later](http://blog.davep.org/2017/07/13/more_revamping_of_my_emacs_config.html).

As with any good development setup, it's an ongoing process and will
continue to evolve. While I obviously am highly unlikely to accept pull
requests for this repo, feedback and ideas for how I might improve it are
always welcome.
