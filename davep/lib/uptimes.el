;;; uptimes.el --- Track and display emacs session uptimes.
;; Copyright 1999,2000,2001,2002 by Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org>
;; $Revision: 2.3 $

;; uptimes is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General
;; Public Licence, version 2. For details see the file COPYING.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; uptimes provides a simple system for tracking and displaying the uptimes
;; of your emacs sessions. Simply loading uptimes.el from your ~/.emacs file
;; will start the tracking of any session.
;;
;; The latest version of uptimes.el can be found at:
;;
;;   <URL:http://www.davep.org/emacs/uptimes.el>

;;; TODO:
;;
;; o The auto-update stuff won't work with xemacs because I'm making use of
;;   `run-at-time'. If anyone knows of a high-level function that does the
;;   same thing and is available in GNU emacs and xemacs I'd love to hear
;;   about it.

;;; THANKS:
;;
;; Istvan Marko <imarko@pacificnet.net> for pointing out that a default of
;; one second for `uptimes-auto-save-interval' was probably a little OTT.
;;
;; Doug Elias <dme7@cornell.edu> for pointing out that midnight.el is a
;; recent addition to emacs.
;;
;; Nix <nix@esperi.demon.co.uk> for pointing out that some XEmacs users
;; might need `inhibit-clash-detection' set to t at points in this code.
