;;; Commentary:

;; ibuffer.el is an advanced replacement for the `buffer-menu' which
;; is normally distributed with Emacs.  Its interface is intended to
;; be analogous to that of Dired.

;; Place this file somewhere in your `load-path', and add:

;; (require 'ibuffer)

;; to your ~/.emacs file.  After that, you should be able to type 'M-x
;; ibuffer' to get started.  'h' will give a brief usage description.

;; Note that if you want to get the best performance out of ibuffer
;; (especially if you usually have more than 50 buffers open), you
;; should byte-compile it.  Type 'M-x emacs-lisp-byte-compile' when
;; you have this file open, and a compiled version will be written in
;; the same directory.

;; A few tips on usage:

;; * If you use global-font-lock-mode, and want fontification in
;;   ibuffer, be sure to say

;; (global-font-lock-mode 1)

;;  before you do (require 'ibuffer) in your ~/.emacs file.  For more
;;  precise control over highlighting, customize the variable
;;  `ibuffer-fontification-level'.

;; Just for fun, here is the author's favorite `ibuffer-formats'
;; configuration:

;; (setq ibuffer-formats '((mark modified read-only " " (name 16 16) " "
;;                         (size 6 -1 :right) " " (mode 16 16 :center)
;;                          " " (process 8 -1) " " filename)
;;                     	   (mark " " (name 16 -1) " " filename))
;;       ibuffer-elide-long-columns t
;;       ibuffer-eliding-string "&")

;; Remember, you can switch between formats using
;; `ibuffer-switch-format', bound to ` by default.

;;; Change Log:

;; Changes from 2.5 to 2.6:

;;  * Make `ibuffer-find-file' compatible with Emacs 20.3 (thanks Syd
;;    Bauman <Syd_Bauman@Brown.edu>).  Note that other parts of
;;    ibuffer currently break with 20.3; patches welcome.
;;  * Following suggestions are from from Dan Jacobson
;;    <jidanni@kimo.com.tw>:
;;  * Run `ibuffer-update' if the user calls `ibuffer' when we're
;;    already in an Ibuffer.  
;;  * Display sorting information in the mode line.
;;  * Place point at beginning of default entry for
;;    `ibuffer-limit-by-mode'.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-copy-filename-as-kill', bound to "w" by
;;    default.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-mark-for-delete-backwards', bound to "C-d"
;;    by default.  (compatibility with buffer-menu)
;;  * New function `ibuffer-visit-buffer-1-window', bound to "M-o" by
;;    default.
;;  * Make `ibuffer-do-view' default to the buffer at point if no
;;    buffers are marked.  (compatibility with buffer-menu)

;; Changes from 2.4 to 2.5:

;;  * Fix `url-link'.
;;  * Only call `ibuffer-update' once when unlimiting.
;;  * Be sure to call `ibuffer-maybe-shrink-to-fit' in all cases.
;;    Patch from Juanma Barranquero <lektu@teleline.es>.
;;  * Use `fit-window-to-buffer' in all cases in Emacs 21.  Patch from
;;    Juanma Barranquero <lektu@teleline.es>.
;;  * Use `eval-and-compile' around the compatibility functions.
;;  * Remove extraneous calls to `ibuffer-maybe-shrink-to-fit'.
;;  * Add tags to defcustom form for `ibuffer-fontification-alist'.
;;    Patch from Alex Schroeder <kensanata@yahoo.com>.
;;  * Change a number of defuns to `defsubst's (and reorganize source a bit).
;;  * Fix position of docstring for `ibuffer-and-update'.

;; Changes from 2.3 to 2.4

;;  * New function `ibuffer-and-update-other-window'.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-auto-mode'.  Use at your own risk.
;;  * Remove multiple definitions of `ibuffer-and-update'.
;;  * When setting `revert-buffer-function' in `ibuffer-occur-mode',
;;    make it buffer local.
;;  * Change home URL and author address.

;; Changes from 2.2 to 2.3

;;  * VERY IMPORTANT CHANGE: Calling 'M-x ibuffer' now only updates
;;    the buffer list when it detects a change in the names of the
;;    buffers.  If you want the old behavior of updating every time
;;    'M-x ibuffer' is called, call 'M-x ibuffer-and-update' instead.
;;    You can bind this to a key just as easily as you can 'M-x
;;    ibuffer'.  This was changed for consistency with Dired (the
;;    interface Ibuffer attempts to emulate), and because Ibuffer is
;;    slow at displaying large numbers of buffers.
;;  * The Limit menu has been reorganized and expanded.
;;  * Saved limits are now "first-class"; you can add them to the
;;    stack, restore them, etc.
;;  * New predefined limit "predicate".  Limit by arbitrary Lisp
;;    forms!
;;  * New function `ibuffer-decompose-limit', bound to '/ d' by default.
;;  * Add default saved limits, "gnus" and "programming".
;;  * New function `ibuffer-negate-limit', bound to '/ !' by default.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-add-saved-limits', bound to '/ a' by default.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-delete-saved-limits', bound to '/ x' by default.
;;  * Fix reference to `ibuffer-or-limit' in ibuffer docstring.
;;  * New variable `ibuffer-eliding-string'.
;;  * Now uses the header-line on Emacs 21 when limits are in effect,
;;    if the variable `ibuffer-use-header-line' is non-nil.

;; Changes from 2.1 to 2.2

;;  * Allow using face names, as well as symbols whose values are face
;;    names, in the FACE position of `ibuffer-fontification-alist'.
;;  * Doc fix in `ibuffer-fontification-alist'.
;;  * Look at the variable `font-lock-auto-fontify' for XEmacs.
;;  * Attempt to fix mouse stuff on XEmacs (again!).
;;  * Allow a negative MIN in `ibuffer-formats' to mean display the
;;    string from the end if it is too long.  This is useful for
;;    filenames, and sometimes buffer names.

;; Changes from 2.0 to 2.1

;;  * Fix name of alphabetic sort function.  Patch from Henrik Enberg
;;    <kirneh74@hem.passagen.se>.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-find-file', which will default to the
;;    directory of the buffer at point.  Bound to 'C-x C-f' by
;;    default.
;;  * Marking and unmarking should be noticeably faster for large
;;    numbers of buffers; there was a silly bug that caused each
;;    buffer to be redisplayed twice.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-jump-to-buffer', bound to "j" by default.
;;  * New variable `ibuffer-default-directory'.  Suggestion by Dan
;;    Jacobson <jidanni@kimo.com.tw>.

;; Changes from 1.9 to 2.0

;;  * Make "dangerous" operations actually operate when
;;    `ibuffer-expert' is non-nil.  Thanks John Wiegley
;;    <johnw@gnu.org> for catching this one!
;;  * Attempt to fix `ibuffer-popup-menu' for XEmacs.  Thanks to
;;    "Dr. Volker Zell" <Dr.Volker.Zell@oracle.com> for catching this.
;;  * Limits are now a stack, instead of only being applicable once.
;;    You can also OR them together now.  This means that you could,
;;    for example, create an ibuffer buffer limited to two major
;;    modes, as well as much fancier things.  See the updated
;;    `ibuffer-mode' documentation for more details.  This creates the
;;    following new user-visible functions: `ibuffer-pop-limit' and
;;    `ibuffer-or-limits'.  Many internal ones were changed.
;;  * Limits can now be saved and restored using mnemonic names, using
;;    the functions `ibuffer-save-limits' and
;;    `ibuffer-switch-to-saved-limits'.  The limits are stored in the
;;    new variable `ibuffer-saved-limits', and can optionally be saved
;;    permanently using Customize, if the new variable
;;    `ibuffer-save-with-custom' is non-nil.
;;  * The macro `ibuffer-define-limiter' no longer takes a useless
;;    parameter.
;;  * The function `ibuffer-unmark-all' now queries for which marks to
;;    delete (like Dired).
;;  * Fix testing for face availability on XEmacs.
;;  * Don't move point after `ibuffer-popup-menu'.
;;  * Allow setting `ibuffer-always-show-last-buffer' to :nomini.
;;    (This one is a hack, hopefully to be implemented better in later
;;    releases.)

;; Changes from 1.8 to 1.9

;;  * Use :value for `const' customization types.  Patch from Alastair
;;    Burt <burt@dfki.de>.
;;  * `ibuffer-do-occur' has been improved substantially.  It now
;;    takes an optional argument NLINES, which specifies the number of
;;    lines of context to give, just like `occur'.  Also like `occur',
;;    `ibuffer-do-occur' can "revert" the buffer (bound to "g" by
;;    default).
;;  * The keybindings "+" and "-" have been changed to only
;;    temporarily hide or show buffers.  The variables
;;    `ibuffer-always-show-regexps' and `ibuffer-never-show-regexps'
;;    are still available, though, for more permanent customization.
;;  * Don't move point when calling `ibuffer-bury-buffer' (thanks
;;    Stefan Reichör <reichoer@riic.at>)
;;  * Use `facep' to test for face names, not `boundp'.
;;  * New variable `ibuffer-always-show-last-buffer'.
;;  * `ibuffer-redisplay' doesn't reorder or refilter the buffers now.
;;    This makes it noticeably faster.
;;  * `ibuffer' now takes two more optional arguments (QUALIFERS and
;;    NAME), which allows you to create specialized Ibuffer buffers
;;    programmatically.  Suggestion from Mario Lang
;;    <mlang@home.delysid.org>.
;;  * The macro `ibuffer-define-limiter' has been improved, so now you
;;    can put all the information needed to define your own limitation
;;    in one place, instead of frobbing `ibuffer-limiting-alist'.  The
;;    predefined limitations are defined using
;;    `ibuffer-define-limiter'.
;;  * New macro `ibuffer-define-sorter'.

;; Changes from 1.7 to 1.8

;;  * New macro `ibuffer-define-column', used internally to define the
;;    built-in columns.  You can use it to define your own columns, as
;;    well.
;;  * Mouse stuff should now work with XEmacs.
;;  * The `ibuffer-formats' variable now allows a :right, :center, or
;;    :left keyword to specify the alignment of a column.
;;  * New variable `ibuffer-elide-long-columns'.
;;  * Fontification in `ibuffer-do-occur' has been improved.  Now
;;    highlights each match in the search (if
;;    `ibuffer-fontification-level' is non-nil).  Suggestion from
;;    jari.aalto@poboxes.com (Jari Aalto+mail.emacs).
;;  * Display the names of buffers being operated on for dangerous
;;    operations, as Dired does.  Suggestion from Roland Winkler
;;    <Roland.Winkler@physik.uni-erlangen.de>.
;;  * New variables `ibuffer-never-show-regexps' and
;;    `ibuffer-maybe-show-regexps'.  Suggestion from Christoph Conrad
;;    <christoph.conrad@gmx.de>.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-bury-buffer', from Christoph Conrad.
;;  * Use diff mode for *Ibuffer-diff* buffers iff it is loaded.
;;  * If `ibuffer-shrink-to-minimum-size', then shrink after buffer
;;    contents are inserted.  Patch from Juanma Barranquero
;;    <lektu@uol.com.br>.
;;  * Test for `font-lock-mode' in XEmacs.  Patch from Nevin Kapur
;;    <nevin@jhu.edu>.
;;  * Several miscellaneous patches from Juanma Barranquero.

;; Changes from 1.6c to 1.7

;;  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Now uses the variable `ibuffer-formats',
;;    which should hopefully be simpler to configure.  The title is
;;    now automatically generated.
;;  * Use `yes-or-no-p' for dangerous operations, instead of
;;    `y-or-n-p'.  Yes, this means you have to type "yes" now for
;;    confirmation instead of just "y"; the change was made for
;;    constistency with Dired.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-mouse-limit-by-mode'.  This allows you to
;;    click on a major mode in the buffer and it will toggle limiting
;;    to that major mode.  This function is bound to mouse-2 by
;;    default.
;;  * Display the directory path in the "Filename" column for Dired
;;    buffers. (To disable this feature, set `ibuffer-dired-filenames'
;;    to nil).
;;  * Thanks to Juanma Barranquero <lektu@uol.com.br> for several
;;    patches.
;;  * Attempt to improve documentation (using checkdoc.el)
;;  * New internal macro `ibuffer-define-limiter'.
;;  * New variable `ibuffer-fontification-alist' which describes how
;;    to fontify buffers.
;;  * Rename variable `ibuffer-colorize-level' to
;;    `ibuffer-fontification-level'.
;;  * New variable `ibuffer-title-face'.
;;  * New variables `ibuffer-use-other-window' and
;;    `ibuffer-shrink-to-minimum-size'.
;;  * Ibuffer now tries to be smarter about setting its modification
;;    flag, like Dired does.  Idea from Roland Winkler.
;;  * Define `ibuffer-do-save' with `ibuffer-define-op'.
;;  * Fix minor bug in `ibuffer-do-save' definition where it wouldn't
;;    switch back to the Ibuffer buffer.
;;  * Make Ibuffer-Occur buffers read-only.

;; Changes from 1.6b to 1.6c

;;  * Add missing `interactive' spec for `ibuffer-do-query-replace'.
;;  * Use &rest to read `query-replace' args.
;;  * Redisplay after an operation.

;; Changes from 1.6a to 1.6b

;;  * Try to use faces depending on whether or not they are defined.

;; Changes from 1.6 to 1.6a

;;  * Change `font-lock-doc-face' to `font-lock-constant-face',
;;    because Emacs 20 doesn't define the former.

;; Changes from 1.5a to 1.6

;;  * Implement multiple formats, and the ability to switch between
;;    them.  This means the variable `ibuffer-line-format' is now
;;    `ibuffer-line-formats', and the variable `ibuffer-title-string'
;;    is now `ibuffer-title-strings'.
;;  * Add colorization for some types of buffers.
;;  * Clean up internals a bit.

;; Changes from 1.5 to 1.5a

;;  * Fix bug in definition of `ibuffer-define-op'.

;; Changes from 1.4 to 1.5

;;  * New variable `ibuffer-directory-abbrev-alist'.
;;  * Include Dired directories in `ibuffer-mark-by-file-name-regexp'.
;;  * New variable `ibuffer-case-fold-search'. (thanks Roland Winkler)
;;  * Don't throw an error upon deletion of the last buffer in the
;;    list.  (thanks Sriram Karra)
;;  * Try not to execute ibuffer operations if we aren't in an ibuffer
;;    buffer. (thanks Sriram Karra)

;; Changes from 1.3a to 1.4

;;  * New function `ibuffer-do-replace-regexp'.
;;  * Check for dead buffers when initializing the prompt of
;;    `ibuffer-mark-by-mode'. (thanks Sriram Karra)
;;  * Don't mark wildcard dired buffers as dissociated. (thanks Roland
;;    Winkler)
;;  * Remove redundant (function ...) declarations.
;;  * Documentation updates.
;;  * Add a `save-excursion' form around operations defined with
;;    ibuffer-define-simple-op.
;;  * New variable `ibuffer-title-string'.
;;  * Remove useless variable `ibuffer-special-modeline'.
;;  * New functions `ibuffer-forward-line', and
;;    `ibuffer-backward-line', used to implement circular traversal.
;;  * `ibuffer-limit-by-mode' now defaults to the major mode of the
;;    buffer at point.

;; Changes from 1.3 to 1.3a

;;  * Name the occur buffer "*Ibuffer-occur*" instead of
;;    " *Ibuffer-occur", so it's easier to switch back to.

;; Changes from 1.2 to 1.3:

;;  * Implementation of multi-buffer `occur'.  This includes a
;;    function `ibuffer-do-occur', a new derived mode,
;;    `ibuffer-occur-mode', and associated helper functions:
;;    `ibuffer-occur-mouse-display-occurence',
;;    `ibuffer-occur-goto-occurence',
;;    `ibuffer-occur-display-occurence'.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-mark-unsaved-buffers'.  This marks buffers
;;     which have an associated file, but are not saved.
;;  * New function `ibuffer-mark-dissociated-buffers'.  This marks
;;    buffers which have an associated file, but the associated file
;;    does not exist.  (suggested by Roland Winkler)
;;  * New function `ibuffer-do-rename-uniquely'.
;;  * New macro `ibuffer-define-simple-op'.
;;  * Define some simple operations using above macro.
;;  * Don't change the current line during `ibuffer-map-lines'.
;;  * Actually define `ibuffer-do-toggle-read-only'  (thanks Roland
;;    Winkler).
;;  * Clean up messages to user.

;; Changes from 1.1 to 1.2:

;;  * Add ability to limit by content (not as slow as you might
;;    think).
;;  * New operations: 'A' to view all of the marked buffers in the
;;    selected frame, and 'H' to view them each in a separate frame.
;;  * Many compatibility keybindings with `buffer-menu' added.
;;  * Add %w format specifier to display narrowing state.
;;  * Add %p format specifier to display buffer process status
;;  * Add %{ %} format modifiers for making text bold
;;  * Add buffer process status to the default display
;;  * New function: ibuffer-diff-with-file, bound to = by default
;;  * Allow using 'd' to mark buffers explicitly for deletion, and
;;    'x' to delete them.  This is orthogonal to the regular marks.
;;  * More documentation.
;;  * Default limiting keybinding changed from # to / (thanks Kai
;;    Großjohann)
;;  * Allow using 0-9 for digit prefix arguments
;;  * New function `ibuffer-other-window', to begin viewing an ibuffer
;;    in another window.
;;  * Move point to the beginning of the buffer when updating (thanks
;;    Kai Großjohann)
;;  * Bury the ibuffer when switching to another buffer (thanks Kai
;;    Großjohann)
;;  * Byte compile the format specifier when entering ibuffer-mode.

;; Changes from 1.0 to 1.1:

;;  * Addition of of "limiting".  You can view only buffers that match
;;    a certain predicate.
;;  * mouse-1 now toggles the highlighting state of a buffer.
;;  * mouse-3 now pops up a menu of operations
;;  * Switch to the buffer being saved if we're prompted for a
;;    filename.
;;  * Do an update every time after 'M-x ibuffer'.
;;  * Keep mark information even when doing an update (g)
;;  * Allow customization of status characters
;;  * Remove killed buffers during mapping (prevents weird errors)
;;  * Start from the beginning of the buffer during a query-replace
;;  * Downcase major mode name during major-mode sorting to prevent
;;    e.g. Man-mode from being first.
;;  * Hide the 'Edit' menu.
;;  * Fix highlighting bug when name is at the beginning
;;  * Don't change point while doing a query replace.

;;; Bugs:

;;  * Ibuffer uses text properties for keeping track of a lot of
;;    things; this is annoying when one copies and pastes text from the
;;    Ibuffer buffer.
;;  * Doing a sort by recency after sorting by another critera doesn't
;;    redisplay the buffers by recency; one has to hit 'g' manually.
;;  * When point is near the end of the ibuffer buffer, when we're
;;    using `ibuffer-use-other-window', and an operation is performed,
;;    the window is recentered farther down, which is not what we
;;    want.
;;  * Under XEmacs, when `ibuffer-use-other-window' is t, window
;;    ordering is messed up for `ibuffer-confirm-operation-on'.
;;  * When `ibuffer-use-other-window' is t, ibuffer calls
;;    `pop-to-buffer' to display the ibuffer. If the current frame has
;;    just two side-by-side windows, that has the unfortunate effect
;;    of chosing one of them to display the ibuffer, which often it is
;;    too narrow.

(defun ibuffer-mode ()
  "A major mode for viewing a list of buffers.
In ibuffer, you can conveniently perform many operations on the
currently open buffers, in addition to limiting your view to a
particular subset of them, and sorting by various criteria.

Operations on marked buffers:

  '\\[ibuffer-do-save]' - Save the marked buffers
  '\\[ibuffer-do-view]' - View the marked buffers in this frame.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-view-other-frame]' - View the marked buffers in another frame.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-revert]' - Revert the marked buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-toggle-read-only]' - Toggle read-only state of marked buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-delete]' - Kill the marked buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-replace-regexp]' - Replace by regexp in each of the marked
          buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-query-replace]' - Query replace in each of the marked buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-query-replace-regexp]' - As above, with a regular expression.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-print]' - Print the marked buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-occur]' - List lines in all marked buffers which match
          a given regexp (like the function `occur').
  '\\[ibuffer-do-shell-command]' - Run a shell command on the contents of
          the marked buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-shell-command-replace]' - Replace the contents of the marked
          buffers with the output of a shell command.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-eval]' - Evaluate a form in each of the marked buffers.  This
          is a very flexible command.  For example, if you want to make all
          of the marked buffers read only, try using (toggle-read-only 1) as
          the input form.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-view-and-eval]' - As above, but view each buffer while the form
          is evaluated.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-kill-lines]' - Remove the marked lines from the *Ibuffer* buffer,
          but don't kill the associated buffer.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-kill-on-deletion-marks]' - Kill all buffers marked for deletion.

Marking commands:

  '\\[ibuffer-mark-forward]' - Mark the buffer at point.
  '\\[ibuffer-toggle-marks]' - Unmark all currently marked buffers, and mark
          all unmarked buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-unmark-forward]' - Unmark the buffer at point.
  '\\[ibuffer-unmark-backward]' - Unmark the buffer at point, and move to the
          previous line.
  '\\[ibuffer-unmark-all]' - Unmark all marked buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-by-mode]' - Mark buffers by major mode.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-unsaved-buffers]' - Mark all \"unsaved\" buffers.
          This means that the buffer is modified, and has an associated file.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-modified-buffers]' - Mark all modified buffers,
          regardless of whether or not they have an associated file.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-special-buffers]' - Mark all buffers whose name begins and
          ends with '*'.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-dissociated-buffers]' - Mark all buffers which have
          an associated file, but that file doesn't currently exist.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-read-only-buffers]' - Mark all read-only buffers.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-dired-buffers]' - Mark buffers in `dired' mode.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-help-buffers]' - Mark buffers in `help-mode', `apropos-mode', etc.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-old-buffers]' - Mark buffers older than `ibuffer-old-time'.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-for-delete]' - Mark the buffer at point for deletion.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-by-name-regexp]' - Mark buffers by their name, using a regexp.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-by-mode-regexp]' - Mark buffers by their major mode, using a regexp.
  '\\[ibuffer-mark-by-file-name-regexp]' - Mark buffers by their filename, using a regexp.

Limiting commands:

  '\\[ibuffer-limit-by-mode]' - Add a limit by major mode.
  '\\[ibuffer-limit-by-name]' - Add a limit by buffer name.
  '\\[ibuffer-limit-by-content]' - Add a limit by buffer content.
  '\\[ibuffer-limit-by-filename]' - Add a limit by filename.
  '\\[ibuffer-limit-by-size-gt]' - Add a limit by buffer size.
  '\\[ibuffer-limit-by-size-lt]' - Add a limit by buffer size.
  '\\[ibuffer-save-limits]' - Save the current limits with a name.
  '\\[ibuffer-switch-to-saved-limits]' - Switch to previously saved limits.
  '\\[ibuffer-add-saved-limits]' - Add saved limits to current limits.
  '\\[ibuffer-or-limit]' - Replace the top two limits with their logical OR.
  '\\[ibuffer-pop-limit]' - Remove the top limit.
  '\\[ibuffer-negate-limit]' - Invert the logical sense of the top limit.
  '\\[ibuffer-decompose-limit]' - Break down the topmost limit.
  '\\[ibuffer-limit-disable]' - Remove all limiting currently in effect.
    
Sorting commands:

  '\\[ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode]' - Rotate between the various sorting modes.
  '\\[ibuffer-invert-sorting]' - Reverse the current sorting order.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-sort-by-alphabetic]' - Sort the buffers lexicographically.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-sort-by-recency]' - Sort the buffers by last viewing time.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-sort-by-size]' - Sort the buffers by size.
  '\\[ibuffer-do-sort-by-major-mode]' - Sort the buffers by major mode.

Other commands:

  '\\[ibuffer-switch-format]' - Change the current display format.
  '\\[forward-line]' - Move point to the next line.
  '\\[previous-line]' - Move point to the previous line.
  '\\[ibuffer-redisplay]' - Redisplay the current buffer list.
  '\\[ibuffer-update]' - As above, but add new buffers to the list.
  '\\[ibuffer-quit]' - Bury the Ibuffer buffer.
  '\\[describe-mode]' - This help.
  '\\[ibuffer-diff-with-file]' - View the differences between this buffer
          and its associated file.
  '\\[ibuffer-visit-buffer]' - View the buffer on this line.
  '\\[ibuffer-visit-buffer-other-window]' - As above, but in another window.
  '\\[ibuffer-visit-buffer-other-window-noselect]' - As both above, but don't select
          the new window.
  '\\[ibuffer-bury-buffer]' - Bury (not kill!) the buffer on this line.

Information on Limiting:

 You can limit your ibuffer view to a selection of the buffers, via
different critera.  For example, suppose you are working on an Emacs
Lisp project.  You can create an Ibuffer buffer which is limited to
just `emacs-lisp' modes via '\\[ibuffer-limit-by-mode] emacs-lisp-mode RET'.

You can combine limits, in a stack-like manner.  For example, suppose
you only want to see buffers in `emacs-lisp' mode, whose names begin
with \"gnus\".  You can accomplish this via:
'\\[ibuffer-limit-by-mode] emacs-lisp-mode RET \\[ibuffer-limit-by-name] ^gnus RET'.

Additionally, you can OR the top two limits together with
'\\[ibuffer-or-limits]'.  To see all buffers in either
`emacs-lisp-mode' or `lisp-interaction-mode', type:

'\\[ibuffer-limit-by-mode] emacs-lisp-mode RET \\[ibuffer-limit-by-mode] lisp-interaction-mode RET \\[ibuffer-or-limits]'.

Limits can also be saved and restored using mnemonic names: see the
functions `ibuffer-save-limits' and `ibuffer-switch-to-saved-limits'.

To remove the top limit on the stack, use '\\[ibuffer-pop-limit]', and
to disable all limiting currently in effect, use
'\\[ibuffer-limit-disable]'."
