;;; Commentary:
;;
;; obfusurl.el provides `obfuscate-url', a command that will obfuscate an
;; URL under the cursor. This might be useful if you are writing out an URL
;; for someone but the URL itself might spoil the surprise.
;;
;; For example, this:
;;
;; <URL:http://www.davep.org/emacs/>
;;
;; is turned into this:
;;
;; <URL:http://www.davep.org/%65%6d%61%63%73/>
;;

;;; THANKS:
;;
;; Andy Sawyer <andys@morebhp.com> for initially pointing out that URLs with
;; percent escapes already in them would get broken.
;;
;; Kevin Rodgers <kevinr@ihs.com> for suggesting a method of fixing the
;; above.
;;
;; Toby Speight <streapadair@gmx.net> for pointing out that I needed to
;; cater for reserved characters.
