# DELPA packages

The files contained in this directory declare and configure my personal
packages that [I keep in my own package
repository](https://blog.davep.org/delpa/). The sorts of files that live
there are packages I've written, that I find personally useful, but would
have doubtful utility if submitted to the likes of
[melpa](https://melpa.org/).
