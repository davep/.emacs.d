# My packages in MELPA

In this directory are the declarations and configurations for [my own
packages that have made it into
MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/?q=davep&sort=downloads&asc=false).

Are they in their own directory for a specific reason? Nope. Just here so I
can find and tweak things quicker if I need to.
